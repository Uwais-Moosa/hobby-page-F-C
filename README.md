# Hobby Page : Uwais's Astronomy Hub
This is my Hobby Page submission for the Founders and Coders Challenge

## Overview

This is a simple, educational webpage about astronomy, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Planning

I planned the webpage to have a clean, dark theme, representing the vastness of space. The navigation bar allows users to easily navigate to various parts of the webpage.

## Building

The webpage was built using basic HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and a bit of JavaScript for adding interactivity (like showing the current date).

## Debugging

Any issues that arose during development were solved by checking the console in the browser's developer tools and using online resources like Stack Overflow.

## Challenges

The process of building this astronomy website posed numerous challenges which have been instrumental in advancing my skills and understanding in web development.

### Research and Content Creation:
The vast majority of my time was spent researching astronomy to generate content for the website. As I wanted the information to be accurate and engaging, sifting through various sources to collect and present facts in a comprehensible way was a significant task.

### Date Format:
Creating a dynamic date display that adhered to the UK/European date format was a challenging aspect of this project. It required a deeper dive into JavaScript's Date object methods and understanding of how to correctly implement locale-specific formatting.

### Adding a Logo and Navbar:
Another challenging aspect was adding a logo to the website and creating a navigational bar. Figuring out how to correctly position the logo and maintain its aspect ratio irrespective of the viewport size required extensive CSS tweaking. Designing and implementing the navigation bar, ensuring that it was both functional and aesthetically pleasing, was another hurdle that I managed to overcome.

### Design and Aesthetics:
One of the most demanding aspects of this project was ensuring the website was aesthetically pleasing. I wanted it to visually reflect the grandeur and wonder of the cosmos. Trying to achieve a balance between functionality and design, choosing the right color schemes, fonts, and image placements proved to be quite a test of my design skills.
